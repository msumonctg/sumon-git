# Login/Registration PHP
<b>Simple login and registration package using PHP.</b><br>
This is a simple login and ragistration package created in PHP. I have used PHP Password hashing technique which is considered most secured nowadays. And I have kept the code as simple as possible.

# Installation
→ First of all keep all this files in your web server directory.<br>
→ Import the database file 'testdb.sql' into your database.<br>
→ This will be fully functional on live web server or any web server with preinstalled mail server. In localhost without preinstalled mail server this package can't work properly.<br>

# Compatibility
<b>→ PHP 7</b>

# Important Instruction
At 'functionHandler.php' make a little change inside function 'send_email' on line no 127 replace example.com with your own site address. Do not make change of any url part following example.com
